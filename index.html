                    <p>Currently tracked at <a href="https://github.com/k2lh/charateka/issues">github</a>. If something breaks,
                    errors, or doesn't work like you expect, check the Issues list and add what you've found. (You'll need a github
                    account, but it's free and is easy to set up.) You can also see an up-to-date list of issues in the footer on
                    every page, once you log in. Just scroll down to see.</p>
